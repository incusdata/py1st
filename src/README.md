# Python First — Source Code

This directory contains a variety of educational Python source code.

## [simple](./simple#py1st-src-simple) — Simple Scripts

These scripts are mostly designed so that each illustrate one Python feature, avoiding practical boilerplate and conventions. They are not necessarily *useful* outside of an educational context.

## [snippets](./snippets#py1st-src-snip) — Re-usable Snippets

Some practical code extracts that can be copied to other scripts where useful.
