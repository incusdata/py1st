# Python First — Source Code

This directory contains a variety of educational Python source code.

## [simple](./simple) — Simple Scripts

These scripts are mostly designed so that each illustrate one Python feature, avoiding practical boiler—plate and conventions. They are not necessarily *useful* outside of an educational context.

## [snippets](./snippets) — Re-usable Snippets

Some practical code extracts that can be copied to other scripts where useful.
